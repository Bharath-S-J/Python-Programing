# Python Programming Workbench

This repository is a comprehensive workbench for a full Python programming course. It covers everything from Python fundamentals to advanced topics like machine learning and web development. The goal of this repo is to serve as both a learning aid and a reference for students or anyone looking to practice and deepen their Python knowledge.

## Features

* **Python Fundamentals**
  Includes basics like variables, data types, loops, conditionals, functions, file handling, and object-oriented programming.

* **Machine Learning**
  Contains code examples and mini-projects using popular ML libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib). Covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

* **Web Application**
  A small Python-based web app built with a framework like Flask or Streamlit (whichever you’ve used). Demonstrates server-side logic, routing, and basic UI rendering.

* **Excel File Handling**
  Scripts that read, write, and manipulate `.xlsx` files using Python libraries such as `openpyxl` or `pandas`. Useful for data automation and reporting tasks.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Bharath-S-J/Python-Programing.git
   cd Python-Programing
   ```

2. **Set up the environment (optional but recommended)**
   If you’re using virtualenv or conda:

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Tech Stack

* **Python** – Core programming language for all scripts and projects
* **pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation and numerical computing
* **matplotlib, seaborn** – Data visualization
* **scikit-learn** – Machine learning algorithms
* **openpyxl or pandas** – Working with Excel files
